I have to focus on the expension operator and on the selection operator


I have noted some key points from Mylene manuscript that could be useful for the current problem.
Models that are used in popIMGEP are often non-parametric.
k-NN is a common example for the selection operator. The model learns during the exploration. It is also based on the expension of the history

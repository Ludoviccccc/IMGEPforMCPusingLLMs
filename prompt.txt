    {"from": "human", "value": """I have a cpu simulator with registers R1 up to R10, and that takes instructions STORE, LOAD, ADD, MUL as input. \n
Here is an example of a list of instructions in this language:
\n DIV R5, R6\n SUB R7, R8 \n LOAD R9, 30\nADD R9, R10\n

    A mutation of a program consists in inserting, deleting or replacing a few instruction in program. For instance, here is a mutation of the code above. I added a LOAD instruction in the fist line and I have replaced the last instruction with a STORE operation.

\nLOAD R4, 30\n DIV R5, R6\n SUB R7, R8 \n LOAD R9, 30\nSTORE R1, 20\n

Can you give me two mutated programs based on the respective following list of instructions bellow?     
Your answer has to be in the following format:

    Mutated programs inside two code blocks
    Reflexion on how you mutate it
First list of instructions:
    LOAD R1, 10\n
    ADD R1, R2\n
    MUL R3, R4\n
    MUL R3, R4\n
    MUL R3, R4\n
    STORE R1, 20\n

Second list of instructions:
    DIV R5, R6
    SUB R7, R8
    LOAD R9, 30
    ADD R9, R10
